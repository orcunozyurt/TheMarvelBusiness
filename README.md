The app should:

Display a list of the first 100 comics from the Marvel API. For each comic at least the thumbnail and title should be displayed


When clicking on one of the comics, detailed information about it should be displayed including title, description, page count, price and authors of the comic


Given a budget, the app should be able to find and list the maximum number of comics that you can buy without exceeding that budget from the 100 comics listed previously. Also all the comics combined should give you the maximum number of pages you can read
